A vending machine application displays items and prices, allows you to insert coins, 
buy an item, get change, get a refund.  

However, there are 3 errors.  Can you solve them?

To start, run Main.java.  You will get a SoldOutException:  Sold Out, Please buy another item.  
Fix the problem so the problem item is no longer Sold Out.  After that, run the Main again, 
and you will be shown the next problem.

Please solve these problems using Test Driven Development.
