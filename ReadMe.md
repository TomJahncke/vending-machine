A vending machine application displays items and prices, allows you to insert coins, 
buy an item, get change, get a refund.  

However, there are 3 errors.  Can you solve them?

To start, run Main.java.  You will get a SoldOutException:  Sold Out, Please buy another item.  

 1.  The Vending Machine should be stocked with 5 of each item.  However, you try to buy a shasta and you get an error.  
     Fix the error so that shasta is no longer sold out.

 2.  You selected a Pepsi.  It is $0.35.  You put in $0.50.  You get your Pepsi but you get the wrong change.  
     Can you fix it so you get the right change?
     
 3.  After buying the Pepsi, the total sales should be $0.35, but it is not.  Can you make the totaling work correctly?
